## Employee Churn Prediction Interface

This repository contains code for an Employee Churn Prediction interface built using Gradio. The interface allows users to input various employee parameters and predicts whether the employee is likely to leave the company or not.

### Input Parameters:
- Satisfaction Level
- Last Evaluation
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly Hours
- Time Spent in Company
- Work Accident (Yes/No)
- Promotion in Last 5 Years (Yes/No)
- Salary (High/Low)

Users can interact with the interface by adjusting the sliders, checkboxes, and dropdown menu to input employee details. The interface then displays the prediction for employee churn based on the provided inputs.
